    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll be conducting some analysis on a subset of a dataset cataloguing posts to the [Hacker News site](https://news.ycombinator.com/news).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we'll hone in on \"Ask HN\", which ask the Hacker News community for answers/opinions on a question, and \"Show HN\" posts, which share a project, product, or something generally interesting with the community. Some examples:\n",
    ">Ask HN: How to improve my personal website? <br>\n",
    "Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts? <br>\n",
    "Show HN: Something pointless I made <br>\n",
    "Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "The key questions we intend to answer are:\n",
    "* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) we're making use of is sourced from Kaggle. Some caveats:\n",
    "* we've reduced the nearly 300,000 rows to 20,000 by removing all submissions not receiving any comments, and then taking a random sample from the remainder. This will lend itself toward more relevant results and hopefully suffice for the light analysis we have planned. \n",
    "* the dataset covers only the 12 months up to September 26 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the description of the data (columns) from the Kaggle details:\n",
    "> * title: title of the post (self explanatory)\n",
    "> * url: the url of the item being linked to\n",
    "> * num_points: the number of upvotes the post received\n",
    "> * num_comments: the number of comments the post received\n",
    "> * author: the name of the account that made the post\n",
    "> * created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)\n",

Given the large variation, there doesn't seem to be much of a strong correlation there. Perhaps better content leads to better engagement.\n",
